# If you dont want to use Reddit:
# edit susbot.py
# and find the line that says:
# reddit = "yes" #yes/no...
# and then change it to "no" like this:
# reddit = "no" #yes/no...
#
# And then when you run the bot, login normally...
# And then press F9.
# It should connect, but may be buggy still.
# Good luck.
